## About the Data Set

The *US College and University Admissions* data set records the admissions rate from many colleges and universities all across the United States from the year 2020-2021. The data set shares the relationship of students' enrollment with their ACT and /or SAT scores. Furthermore, the data set examines the number of applicants each university recieved and compares these numbers to the number of those admitted and enrolled into the university.

## Introduction Page

When you first open our shiny app you are greeted with an aesthetic image of the *University of Washington* to set the stage for our data of U.S colleges/universities. There is a broad overview of what we are trying to convey through our data, who we are trying to reach with our data, where we sourced our data from, as well as a brief description of the purpose of the plots & tables we created.

## SAT and ACT Plot

   - The user can change the range of the scores and choose which regions they want plotted on the graph, which           outputs a scatter plot that displays text

In the table page, there is a table that shows the average SAT and ACT scores for math/reading in each U.S state.
- To navigate all 50 states, there is a tab to the left that allows the user to select the state they want to see the average of
- To go along with this, there is also a brief description of what the average is that changes for each state below the table.

## Conclusion Page

For the conclusion, we listed our discoveries based off of our data. We took a look at the overall trends and patterns of the data, what those trends meant, the quality of the data, and future ideas. Our conclusion is geared towards our target audience of mainly U.S schools and what the relevance of SAT/ACT scores are in the future.
